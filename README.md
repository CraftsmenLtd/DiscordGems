# ðŸ’Ž DiscordGems ðŸ’Ž
A simple serverless discord bot written in python3.8 that can be used to appreciate your squad members by giving them ðŸ’Žs. The given ðŸ’Žs are stored and can be ranked to see who's had the most appreciation or who appreciated the most. We've created this tool here at [Craftsmen](https://craftsmenltd.com) to appreciate our colleagues for things that they do to make our lives easier.

## Get Familiar With ðŸ’Ž
https://emojipedia.org/gem-stone
For discord the short code is :gem:

## Our Commands
- `/gem appreciate <a_user> <a message containing ðŸ’Ž emojis>`: Must include :gem: emoji. You can have up to `max_gems_per_day` :gem: emojis in the message
- `/gem rank`: Ranks the ðŸ’Ž leader board
- `/gem opt-out`: Use this command to opt-out of receiving ðŸ’Ž appreciations.
- `/gem opt-in`: Use this command to opt-in again for receiving ðŸ’Ž appreciations after opting out.

*This is our implementation. We've tried to write the code in an extensible way. We will keep working on it as we see fit. We encourage the community to raise pull requests and help us fix issues.*

## Getting Started ðŸ˜„
We've tried to make it as extensible as we can. Hence why there are so many parameters to set.

### Tool Set
- Python3.8
- AWS
- Docker

### Passing Terraform Variables as Environment
If you run the terraform code in our provided container you must pass terraform variables as TF_VARS.
Example:
```shell
TF_VARS='-var="prefix=a_prefix" -var="max_gems_per_day=5"' make run-command-in-container-deploy
```

## How to Deploy from Local Machine ðŸ’»
Run the following commands one by one. Make sure you have made sure all environment variables are set appropriately.

Build a docker image to run the code in. The image contains all required dependencies the app needs.
```shell
make build-runner-image
```
Run a quick terraform validation check.
```shell
make run-command-in-container-validate-terraform
```
Deploy terraform code
```
make run-command-in-container-deploy
```
Register the Bot with Discord
```shell
make run-command-in-container-register-bot
